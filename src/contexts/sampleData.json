    "description": "a quintessential childhood food.  this is a copycat recipe of the traditional zwieback toast that we grew up on, gave to our own kids, and may even be giving to our grandkids now.  my daughter has an allergy to cow's milk, so i substitute the milk for half water and half coconut milk and it works out perfectly!!   note: it takes two days to make these cookies.  the first day, you make a raised loaf (just like you do when making yeast bread).  the baked loaf sits to cool and set during the night.  the next day, the loaf is cut into slices and put in the oven to dry.  a lot more work than buying them off the store shelf, but your toddler will love you for it -- i promise!!  time to make does not include kneading time and raising time - just the time it takes to mix the ingredients together and baking time.   this recipe is from kingarthurflour.com.",

    "description": "recipe courtesy of b&c seafood, vacherie, la adapted from alton brown's cookbook \"feasting on asphalt\".  take this to your next covered-dish dinner or picnic.  finding the italian\r\nolive salad-the chopped olive spread that's an essential component of a\r\nmuffaletta sandwich-is the trick.  if you can't find it at the megamart do a search on 'zaar, there are many authentic recipes.\r\n  if you have minor's kalamata olive base, be sure to use it in the olive spread.  three bean salad: b&c seafood uses \"read\" brand of three-bean salad.  if you can't find it at your grocery store try www.senecafoods.com.  the olive salad and canned beans marry into the lettuce and tomatoes.  zydeco comes from \"les haricorts cont pas sales\", which means \"the beans aren't salty\", an expression for hard times when there wasn't enough salt meat to season the beans.  so this salad, with it's three different beans, is actually zydeco and the musical genre is named after it.  food is facinating stuff.  edited 5-18-09  i just made another batch of this, found a huge jar of the bean salad at costco.  this is so good, i could live on this salad.  you really need to try this one.  i made my olive salad from scratch this time with both kalamata and green olives, and will continue to go this route.",
